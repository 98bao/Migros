 1) At first we submitted a simple logistic regression without data cleaning which gave us a satisfying accuracy of **0.805** on AICrowd
  
  2) We cleaned the text by deleting unecessary elements, then applied a logistic regression with cross validation (LRCV). Although the model built on the train data is pretty good, the accuracy on AICrowd got lower: **0.797**

  3) We used the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) and its model accuracy seemed very promising (0.97 for the train data) however, whilst submitting to AICrowd we got only a result of **0.77**. It seems like we are missing an important point as our accuracy keeps getting lower. Perhaps our model is overfitting the train data, thus we have to correct our parameters
