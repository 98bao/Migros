## Group Migros - Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets

## Project Description

This project aims to buils a machine learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which ones are not. 
The model will be trained with the dataset of classified tweets provided by the university. The topic is based around a Kaggle competion. 
In order to improve the prediction accuracy, techniques from the class and lab of the course Data Mining and Machine Learning held by professor Michalis Vlachos will be used.

### Nico 
1) Data exploratary features: top keywords, plots of dataframe for target = [1,0], check for duplicates, null values

### Abi
2) Data cleaning: remove @Tagged, replace "%20" by space, remove http://%, check for weird stuff, delete words of 2 or less characters. Replace null values by something

### Bryan
3) Test other regression, use keyword column
